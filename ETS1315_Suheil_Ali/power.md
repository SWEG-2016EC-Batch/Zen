## Problem analaysis

- Input: the base and the power 

- Process: calculsting the base and power as base^exponent

- output: calculated number
  
  ## Pseudocode
  
  steps:
  
  1. start the program
  
  2. read base and power as x , y respectively
  
  3. if x and y are not numbers goto line 2
  
  4. calculate the result as result= x^y
  
  5. display result
  
  6. stop the program
