- Input: capacity in gallon of an automobile in fuel tank and the miles it travel per gallon

- Process: calculate the total mile it travel

- Output: display the total mile it can travel without refueling
  
  ## Pseudocode
  
  Steps:
  
  1. start the program
  
  2. Read the amout in gallon and the mile it travel per gallon as miles_per_gallon , amount_in_gallon respectively
  
  3. calculate total miles as tot_miles=(miles_per_gallon) x (amount_in_gallon)
  
  4. display tot_miles for total miles
  
  5. stop the program
