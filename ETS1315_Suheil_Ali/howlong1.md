## Problem Analaysis

- Input: file size

- Process: Calculate how long it will take and put in the time catagory

- Output: Display the time it will take
  
  ## Pseudocode
  
  steps:
  
  1. Start the program
  
  2. Read transmission rate as 960 per byte or character
  
  3. Read filesize
  
  4. If file size in MB change Bytes= filesize*1,048,576
  
  5. time in sec calculated as time = byte/transmission
  
  6. Time catagory
     
     - time>86,400 .......... day = time/86,400
     
     - time>3,600........hour=time/3600
     
     - time>60......minute=time/60
     
     - or time= time in sec
  
  7. Print the time with respect to it's time catagory
  
  8. End the program
