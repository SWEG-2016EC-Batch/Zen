## Hangman Game
Mr. Abay teaches second grade at Kokebe Tsibah School. On days when the weather is bad and
the students cannot go outside to play, he spends recess (break) time playing the Hangman
game with his students. The game requires two people to play. Currently, Mr. Abay thinks of a
word that has five letters. He then draws five dashes on the black-board, one for each letter in
the word. One student then is chosen to guess the word, letter by letter. When the student
guesses a correct letter, He replaces the appropriate dash or dashes with the letter. For
example, if the original word is moose and the student guesses the letter o, Mr. Abay changes
the five dashes on the black-board to _ oo _ _. The game is over when the student either
guesses all of the letters in the word or makes 10 incorrect guesses.   

Write a C++ program that allows two students to play the game on the computer. The program
should prompt one player two enter words of any length and allow the second player to guess
the word and then the program control the game as described above. The two players continue
playing the game interchangeable until they get tired and stop. When the player stop playing
the game, the program should print how many times each player plays as a guesser along with
how many times they "Won!" and "Lose!".
