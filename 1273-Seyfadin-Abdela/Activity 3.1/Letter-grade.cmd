Flow Design (Short)

1. Start


2. Input: Marks for Test, Quiz, Project, Assignment, and Final Exam


3. Calculate:

Total Mark = (Test × 0.15) + (Quiz × 0.05) + (Project × 0.20) + (Assignment × 0.10) + (Final Exam × 0.50)



4. Determine Grade:

If Total Mark ≥ 90, Grade = A+

Else If 80 ≤ Total Mark < 90, Grade = A

Else If 75 ≤ Total Mark < 80, Grade = B+

Else If 60 ≤ Total Mark < 75, Grade = B

Else If 45 ≤ Total Mark < 60, Grade = C

Else If 30 ≤ Total Mark < 45, Grade = D

Else, Grade = F



5. Output: Display Total Mark and Corresponding Letter Grade


6. End
